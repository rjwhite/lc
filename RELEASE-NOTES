0.4     Oct 31, 2022:
    lc.plx:
        - total overhaul in handling print formatting to address Issue #1 from
          Ian! Allen: "differing output compared with 2005 UW version in C"
          It still will only have a max of 14 chars per column to be consistent
          with all columns - not just the last one - but the code has been
          totally overhauled to be clearer.
        - changed order of filetypes printed to be consistent with original lc
        - include extra newline between filetypes when used with option -1 to
          to be consistent with original version
        - code refactoring.
    README.md:
        - made more clear that the behaviour is based on the original lc and
          is not guaranteed to be identical behaviour

0.5     Nov 1, 2022:
    lc.plx:
        - over-hauled in handling print formatting again.  If there is room to
          squeeze in an entry in the last column even if is is slightly longer
          than the 14 character width, then go for it so long as it is within
          the terminal width.  More aesthetically pleasing.

0.6     Nov 3, 2022:
    lc.plx:
        - refactoring.  getting all line lengths < 80 chars
        - the handling of the spacing is smarter now.

    lc.1:
        - complete rewrite of man page.
          moved old (mostly) UW version to lc-uw.1
    lc.plx:
        - now uses the environment variable LC_COLUMN_WIDTH to change column
          width from default of 14 characters
        - added more info to perldoc and corrected some info
    README.md:
        - updated

0.8     Nov 26, 2022:
    lc.plx:
        - now has a mainline, reducing globals to $G_progname and $G_version
        - added an error() function with flag for whether to exit or not
        - prints useful error messages if LC_COLUMN_WIDTH is wrong (Issue #2)
        - wasn't printing command for usage (-h)
        - no such pathname now treated like any other error - to STDERR
        - refactoring, more/better comments
